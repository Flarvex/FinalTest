            <h1>Antidepressant Medications</h1>
    
    <p>Antidepressant medications are commonly prescribed to help manage the symptoms of depression. They work by altering the levels of certain chemicals in the brain, known as neurotransmitters, which play a role in regulating mood. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any medication for depression, as they can assess your specific needs and monitor your progress throughout treatment.</p>

    <h2>Common Antidepressant Medications:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs):</strong> SSRIs are one of the most commonly prescribed types of antidepressants. They work by increasing the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter associated with mood regulation. Common SSRIs include:
            <ul>
                <li>Fluoxetine (Prozac)</li>
                <li>Sertraline (Zoloft)</li>
                <li>Escitalopram (Lexapro)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs):</strong> SNRIs are another type of antidepressant that increases levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain. Common SNRIs include:
            <ul>
                <li>Venlafaxine (Effexor)</li>
                <li>Duloxetine (Cymbalta)</li>
                <li>Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs):</strong> TCAs are an older class of antidepressants that work on multiple neurotransmitters. They are usually prescribed when other treatments haven't been effective. Common TCAs include:
            <ul>
                <li>Amitriptyline (Elavil)</li>
                <li>Nortriptyline (Pamelor)</li>
                <li>Imipramine (Tofranil)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs):</strong> MAOIs are another older class of antidepressants. They are prescribed less frequently due to potential interactions with certain foods and other medications. Common MAOIs include:
            <ul>
                <li>Phenelzine (Nardil)</li>
                <li>Tranylcypromine (Parnate)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Atypical Antidepressants:</strong> These antidepressants don't fit into the above categories but can still be effective in treating depression. Common atypical antidepressants include:
            <ul>
                <li>Bupropion (Wellbutrin)</li>
                <li>Mirtazapine (Remeron)</li>
                <li>Trazodone (Desyrel)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Keep in mind that the effectiveness of antidepressant medications can vary from person to person. Your healthcare provider will work with you to find the most suitable medication and dosage for your specific needs. It's essential to follow their guidance and attend follow-up appointments to monitor your progress during treatment.</p>
